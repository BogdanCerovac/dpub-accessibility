      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>This document provides informative guidance (but does not set requirements) with regard to interpreting and applying Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 [WCAG20] to the needs of digital publishing.</p>
      <p>While the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)'s W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is primarily concerned with web technologies, its guidance is also relevant to non-web technologies, such as digital publishing published using web-based technological tools.</p>
      <p>The current document is focused on the accessibility of digital publishing to people with disabilities and is not intended to supplant any other W3C work. </p>

<section class="introductory">
      <h3>WCAG 2.0 and Digital Publishing</h3>
      <p><em>"Digital Publishing"</em> is a generic term for the broad ecosystem of electronic journals, magazines, news, or book publishing (authors, creators, publishers, news organizations, booksellers, accessibility and internationalization specialists, etc.). The formats used by eBook readers and tablets for electronic books, magazines, journals and educational resources are largely based on W3C Technologies, such as (X)HTML, CSS, SVG, SMIL, MathML, or various Web API-s. Commercial publishers also rely on W3C technologies in their back-end processing all the way from authoring through to delivering the printed or electronic product and beyond. In general one can say that the Publishing Industry is one of the largest communities relying large palette of W3C technologies. </p>
      <p> However, the alignment of the needs of the Publishing Industry and the various W3C recommendations is not satisfactory. Necessary features may be missing in the W3C documents, or may be in draft only; as a result, for example, EPUB3, the standard for electronic books, had to introduce its own extensions to cover the needs of publishing.</p>
</section>
<section class="introductory">
      <h2>Other W3C-WAI Guidelines Related to Digital Publishing</h2>
<section class="introductory">
      <h3>UAAG 2.0</h3>
      <p>The User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0 [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">UAAG2</a>]   is meant for the developers of user agents (e.g. web browsers and e-readers). A user agent that follows UAAG 2.0 will improve accessibility through its own user interface, through options it provides for rendering and interacting with ​content, and through its ability to communicate with other technologies, including assistive technologies.</p>
      <p>To assist developers of e-readers, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20-Reference/">UAAG 2.0 Reference</a> support document needs to contain examples relevant to digital publishing. It has not been within the scope of this task force to create a note with some examples for the UAAG team. However, it should be a product of future digital publishing accessibility work.</p>
</section>
<section class="introductory">
      <h3>ATAG 2.0</h3>
      <p>The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">ATAG2</a>] provides guidelines for the developers of authoring tools. An authoring tool that follows ATAG 2.0 will be both more accessible to authors with disabilities (Part A) and designed to enable, support, and promote the production of more accessible web content by all authors (Part B). </p>
      <p>To assist developers of authoring tools for digital publishing, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20/">Implementing ATAG 2.0</a> support document needs to contain examples relevant to digital publishing. It has not been within the scope of this task force to create a note with some examples for the ATAG team. However, it should be a product of future digital publishing accessibility work.</p>

    <h2>Discussion of Digital Publishing Issues not currently addressed by W3C standards</h2>
        <section>

        <h3>Page Numbers</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: </p>
        <p>Comments: </p>
        <p>References:</p>


        <h3>Drop Cap</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: UAAG suggestion</p>
        <p>Comments: in new CSS standards but not widely supported. Only an accessibility issue if people are doing bad markup (dropped cap gets read separately.) Outreach to user agent creators and content creators needed.</p>
        <p>References:</p>
        <ul>
             <li>http://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3/Selectors/pseudo-elements/:first-letter</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Notes (Footnotes, Asides, Author Notes, etc.)</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: No action item</p>
        <p>Comments: DPUB-ARIA 1.0 includes <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-dpub-aria-1.0-20150707/#dpub-footnote">dpub-footnote</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-dpub-aria-1.0-20150707/#dpub-footnotes">dpub-footnotes</a>. These roles convey that information is ancillary without conveying information about positioning. This allows authors and user agents to achieve positioning using CSS or scripting while maintaining the flow and navigability of the content.</p>
        <p>References:</p>

        <h3>Positional location of text to indicate different speakers</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: Unclear. Possibly all use cases can be addressed with CSS.</p>
        <p>Use cases:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Use Case: comic strips have different speakers on different sides of the page. </li>
             <li>Use Case: poetry </li>
             <li>Use Case: different voices for different speakers. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>References:</p>
        <ul>
             <li>http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-speech/</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>phonetic spellings of proper nouns</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: UAAG and WCAG suggestion</p>
        <p>Comments: Pronunciation Lexicon (PLS) exists but it is exceptionally  difficult to use.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>link to a URI to a pronunciation dictionary in your document..  eg. if you are writing a chemistry book to link to a chemistry pronunciation dictionary, local or shared.  </li>
            <li>support the linked pronunciation dictionary in reading systems.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>References:</p>
        <ul>

             <li>http://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-lexicon/</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>layout's influence on comprehension</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: No action item</p>
        <p>Comments: we can bring this as an issue in our Note but we don't have a solution</p>
        <p>References:</p>
        <ul>
             <li>http://www.w3.org/2015/05/15-dpub-minutes.html#item02</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Deeply Nested Heading Levels Best Practices</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: Techniques / Tutorials suggestion</p>
        <p>Comments: It is not easy to determine what best practice is for deeply nested  headings, headings that go beyond &lt;h6&gt;. Best Practices should be clearly established and easy to find.  Use cases in books are more frequent than other circumstances. This is likeliest to occur if an &lt;aside&gt; begins with &lt;h5&gt; or &lt;h6&gt;. It may  also occur in encyclopedias and similarly larger and detailed works.</p>
        <p>References:</p>
        <ul>
             <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/05/15-dpub-minutes.html#item03"></a></li>
             <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_role%3Dheading"></a></li>
             <li><a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2015AprJun/0039.html"></a></li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Semantically needed List-Head</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: WCAG suggestion</p>
        <p>Comments: There is no clear method of associating a title of a list with the list items. This can be accomplished using artificial wrappers, such as &lt;div&gt;, but it seems that the list elements (&lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;) should include titles. It is tempting to use the h1 – h6 elements, but these have the native semantics of aria role=”heading”, offering unwanted default navigation. It would be useful if there were a role of element called "listtitle" or something similar.</p>
        <p>The following is a simple example:
<pre>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;listtitle&gt;Noble Gases&lt;/listtitle&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Argon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Krypton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xenon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
</p>
        <p>References:</p>
        <ul>
             <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/05/15-dpub-minutes.html#item04"/></li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Skippability</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: UAAG suggestion</p>
        <p>Comments: This is a user preference / personalization issue. User must be able to customize what is visible, what is read, etc.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>This should be an option for visual as well as aural presentation.</li>
            <li>Skipped elements need to be discoverable later.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Use cases:</p>
        <ul>
             <li>Use Case: User does not want to hear page numbers or headers, but does want to hear footnotes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>References:</p>

        </ul>


        <h3>Assessments</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: UAAG suggestion</p>
        <p>Comments: Mark Hakkinen is driving gap analysis and merging IMS QTI/APIP accessibility model to HTML/ARIA and WCAG. The bulk of these recommendations will come from their group; we will coordinate with them as they request. We've done initial outreach.  </p>
        <p>Use cases:</p>
        <ul>
             <li>Use Case: Use Case: admins need to be able to control who gets extra time on timed controls, and how much.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>References:</p>
        <ul>
             <li>https://www.w3.org/community/accesslearn/</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Escapability</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: UAAG suggestion</p>
        <p>Comments: Need to be able to immediately move to the next non-contained block element.</p>
        <p>Use cases:</p>
        <ul>
             <li>Use Case: Skip from the middle of a long, complex table to the next paragraph or header.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Diagrammar</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: AI for DPub: research</p>
        <p>Comments: DPUG IG a11y needs to research Diagrammar and decide what if any recommendations we will give either to WCAG, UAAG, or the Diagrammar team.</p>
        <p>References:</p>
        <ul>
             <li>http://diagramcenter.org/</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Annotations</h3>
        <p>Suggestion: No action item</p>
        <p>Comments: User created annotations and Highlights adding your own notes to a document must be accessible for creation and use. George has raised this with annotations WG.</p>
